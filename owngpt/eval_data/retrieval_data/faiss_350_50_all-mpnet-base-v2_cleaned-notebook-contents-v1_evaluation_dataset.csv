# Autograd: automatic differentiation

Central to all neural networks in PyTorch is the ``autograd`` package.
Let’s first briefly visit this, and we will then go to training our first neural network.

The `autograd` package provides automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors.
It is a define-by-run framework, which means that your backprop is defined by how your code is run, and that every single iteration can be different.

Let us see this in more simple terms with some examples.'

 
markdown:
## 1. Tensor

`torch.Tensor` is the central class of the package. Setting the attribute `.requires_grad` to `True` will make the tensor ""record"" all operations on it. When you finish your computation you can call `.backward()` and have all the gradients computed automatically. The gradient for this tensor will be accumulated into the `.grad` attribute.

![autograd.Variable](../static_files/autograd-variable.png)

There’s one more class which is very important for autograd implementation - a `Function`.

`Tensor` and `Function` are interconnected and build up an acyclic graph, that encodes a complete history of computation. Each tensor has a `.grad_fn` attribute that references a `Function` that has created the `Tensor` (except for Tensors created by the user - their `grad_fn` is `None`).",0.9767199754714966,notebook 3_1,1.0,"code:

Assigning a Tensor doesn’t have such effect. This is because one might want to cache some temporary state (more on this later) in the model. If there was no such class as `Parameter`, these temporaries would get registered too.'

# Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Reading material: [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and (optionally) [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWea12EAu6U&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z).

___

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that has been succesful in modelling sequential data, e.g. language, speech, protein sequences, etc.

A RNN performs its computations in a cyclic manner, where the same computation is applied to every sample of a given sequence.
The idea is that the network should be able to use the previous computations as some form of memory and apply this to future computations.
An image may best explain how this is to be understood,

## Reducing variance

By default, this gradient estimator has high variance and therefore variance reduction becomes important to learn more complex tasks.
We can reduce variance by subtracting a baseline from the returns, which is unbiased in expectation:

$$
\abla_\\theta \\mathbb{E}[R|\\theta] \\approx \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=0}^T \abla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(a_t|s_t) (R_t-b_t) \\ ,
$$

where the baseline, $b_t$, is estimated by the return a timestep $t$ averaged over $V$ rollouts.

$$
b_t = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{v=1}^V R_t^{(v)} \\ .

# Assignments

1. A linear logistic classifier is only able to create a linear decision boundary. Change the Logistic classifier into a (nonlinear) Neural network by inserting a dense hidden layer between the input and output layers of the model
 
2. Experiment with multiple hidden layers or more / less hidden units. What happens to the decision boundary?
 
3. Overfitting: When increasing the number of hidden layers / units, the neural network will fit the training data better by creating a highly nonlinear decision boundary. If the model is too complex it will often generalize poorly to new data (validation and test set). Can you observe this from the training and validation errors? 
 
4. We used the vanilla stochastic gradient descent algorithm for parameter updates. This usually converges slowly and more sophisticated pseudo-second-order methods usually work better. Try changing the optimizer to [adam or momentum](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Adam)'

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

**2019 update:** Changes have been made to the display of environments due to the previous `viewer` being incompatible with newer versions of Gym.

**2022 update:** Rendering was disabled, and the notebook now uses the `colabgymrender` package to render a video.

In this lab we will create neural network reinforcement learning agents with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to navigate various environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

Please refer to the [docs](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) on how to get started with Gym. You are also encouraged to take a look at this short [post on the OpenAI blog](https://blog.openai.com/openai-gym-beta/).'

## Installation

Below is a brief guide on how to install OpenAI Gym. For more details, please refer to the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/gym) and the [docs](https://gym.openai.com/docs).

You can do a minimal install of the packaged version of Gym directly from PyPI:

```
pip install gym
```

Or you can perform a minimal install from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git
cd gym
pip install -e .

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

# Transfer learning on the Caltech101 dataset

In this notebook, we will consider a more complex dataset than MNIST or CIFAR10. The images in Caltech101 are RGB images (3 channels) with variable size. There are 101 different classes. We will try a very common practice in computer vision nowadays: transfer learning from a pre-trained ImageNet model. 

Roadmap:
- Modify the network from the previous exercise (CIFAR-10) to work with 224x224 images.
- Train the model for a while on Caltech101 and see how far we can get.
- Take a ResNet34 that was pre-trained on ImageNet-1k and fine-tune it to Caltech101.
  - Consider both training only the head (the linear classifier at the end of the network) or the entire network.
  - We should be able to reach better performance than our original network in fewer training steps.
- Optional: play around with other pre-trained models from `timm` (see info [here](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models)).'

## Define a neural network

**Assignment 1:** Adapt the CNN from the previous lab (CIFAR-10) to handle 224x224 images.

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

# Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Reading material: [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and (optionally) [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWea12EAu6U&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z).

___

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that has been succesful in modelling sequential data, e.g. language, speech, protein sequences, etc.

A RNN performs its computations in a cyclic manner, where the same computation is applied to every sample of a given sequence.
The idea is that the network should be able to use the previous computations as some form of memory and apply this to future computations.
An image may best explain how this is to be understood,

![rnn-unroll image](https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning-with-PyTorch/blob/master/static_files/rnn-unfold.png?raw=1)


where it the network contains the following elements:",0.9594320058822632,notebook 4_1,1.0,"*So what is the difference?*
The networks we saw previously are called *dense* because each unit receives input from all the units in the previous layer. This is not the case for ConvNets. In ConvNets each unit is only connected to a small subset of the input units. This is called the *receptive field* of the unit.

#### Example
The input (green matrix) is a tensor of size `1x5x5` -- i.e. it has one ""channel"" (like a grayscale image), and the feature map has size `5x5`. Let us define a `1x3x3` kernel (yellow submatrix). The kernel weights are indicated in red at the bottom right of each element. The computation can be thought of as an elementwise multiplication followed by a sum. Here we use a *stride* of 1, as shown in this animation:

After having convolved the image, we perform an elementwise non-linear transformation on the *convolved features*.
In this example, the input is a 2D *feature map* with depth 1.'

# Week 5 - Recurrent Neural Networks

In this lab, we will introduce different ways of learning from sequential data.

As a recurring example, we will train neural networks to do language modelling, i.e. predict the next token in a sentence. In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals, or videos, just to name a few.

To really get a grasp of what is going on inside a recurrent neural network (RNN), we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in Nanograd rather than PyTorch.

1. A linear logistic classifier is only able to create a linear decision boundary. Change the Logistic classifier into a (nonlinear) Neural network by inserting a dense hidden layer between the input and output layers of the model
 
2. Experiment with multiple hidden layers or more / less hidden units. What happens to the decision boundary?
 
3. Overfitting: When increasing the number of hidden layers / units, the neural network will fit the training data better by creating a highly nonlinear decision boundary. If the model is too complex it will often generalize poorly to new data (validation and test set). Can you observe this from the training and validation errors?

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that has been succesful in modelling sequential data, e.g. language, speech, protein sequences, etc.

A RNN performs its computations in a cyclic manner, where the same computation is applied to every sample of a given sequence.
The idea is that the network should be able to use the previous computations as some form of memory and apply this to future computations.

A vanilla RNN suffers from [the vanishing gradients problem](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap5.html#the_vanishing_gradient_problem) which gives challenges in saving memory over longer sequences.

The two most prominent gated hidden units are the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both of which have shown increased performance in saving and reusing memory in later timesteps. In this exercise, we will focus on LSTM but you would easily be able to go ahead and implement the GRU as well based on the principles that you learn here.

## Representing tokens or text

In previous labs we mainly considered data $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the feature space dimension.
With time sequences our data can be represented as $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d}$, where $t$ is the sequence length. 
This emphasises sequence dependence and that the samples along the sequence are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).

With RNNs, we can model both many-to-one functions: $\\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^c$ and many-to-many functions: $\\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, c}$, where $c$ is the amount of classes/output dimensions.

There are several ways to represent sequences. With text, the challenge is how to represent a word as a feature vector in $d$ dimensions, as we are required to represent text with decimal numbers in order to apply neural networks to it.",1.0054212808609009,notebook 5_2,45.0,"markdown:

- $h_t = f(U\\,{x_t} + V\\,{h_{t-1}})$, where $f$ is a non-linear activation function, e.g. $\\mathrm{tanh}$.
- $o_t = W\\,{h_t}$

When we are doing language modelling using a cross-entropy loss, we additionally apply the softmax function to the output $o_{t}$:

- $\\hat{y}_t = \\mathrm{softmax}(o_{t})$


### Backpropagation through time

We define a loss function

- $E = \\sum_t E_t  = \\sum_t E_t(y_t ,\\hat{y}_t ) \\ , $

where $E_t(y_t ,\\hat{y}_t )$ is the cross-entropy function.

Backpropagation through time amounts to computing the gradients of the loss using the same type of clever bookkeeping we applied to the feed-forward network in week 1. This you will do in Exercise D.'

## III. Attention mechanism and Transformers


The attention mechanism was first introduce in machine learning for machine translation tasks [(""Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate"", Bahdanau et al. (2014))](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473). Translation is a sequence-to-sequence problem which goal is to generate a translation of a source text. The attention mechanism was introduced to allow *attenting* the whole source text at any of the generation steps. We implement attention with the softmax function because it is a differential version of a hard zero-one attention.

In this section, we will introduce the *scaled dot-product* self-attention mechanism and the Transformer architecture [(""Attention is All You Need"", Wasrani et al. (2016))](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

### III.a Attention mechanism

Attention has become a very important concept in deep learning beginning with [""Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate"", Badanau et. al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473). The idea key idea in that paper is that when you translate a sentence from for example German to English then it is a good is helpful for the model when it generates",0.8984218835830688,notebook 5_1,36.0,"markdown:
**Experiment** We will use the GloVe word vectors to illustrate the attention mechanism. 

We define queries and keys using the GloVe word vectors correspond to country names:
$$
\\begin{align}
\\mathbf{Q} =& [\\mathrm{vec(""Italy"")}, \\mathrm{vec(""Korea"")}, \\mathrm{vec(""Nicaragua"")}, \\ldots] \\\\
\\mathbf{K} =& [\\mathrm{vec(""China"")}, \\mathrm{vec(""Russia"")}, \\mathrm{vec(""Turkey"")}, \\ldots] \\ .
\\end{align}
$$
The inner-product between paris is of country vectors will have a large values when the vectors are similar, this might happend when two countries are geographically or culturally close to each other because of the properties of the GloVe vectors. The last component required to apply the attention mechanism is set of value vectors $\\mathbf{V}$.",0.9687864780426025,notebook 5_1,45.0,"markdown:
### III.b Self-attention

The attention mechanism is a transformation of a sequence of vectors $\\mathbf{Q}$ given all the values in the sequence $\\mathbf{V}$. In a self-attention layers, the attention layer is parameterized with transformations of the input sequence $\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}$ as parameters, which allows processing each vector in a sequence $\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}$ based on all the other locations. The output of the self-attention layer is a sequence of hidden states:
$$
 \\mathbf{h}_{1:T} = \\mathrm{Attention} \\left(\\mathbf{Q}(\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}), \\mathbf{K}(\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}), \\mathbf{V}(\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}) \\right)

**Architecture** A Transformer is composed of two main components: a decoder which implements a language model and an encoder. The encoder is only required for conditional language models like those used in translation tasks. Each of the two components is made by stacking Transformer layers (layers with and without conditioning). Each layer transforms a sequence of hidden state $\\mathbf{h}_{1:T}^l$ into another sequence $\\mathbf{h}_{1:T}^{l+1}$. The input tokens are converted into the first state $\\mathbf{h}_{1:T}^0$ using an embedding layer coupled with positioal encodings. the last hidden state $\\mathbf{h}_{1:T}^{L}$ is projected into the vocabulary space using a liner layer.'

### IV.b Masked attention

The self-attention layer allows computing the hidden state $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ based on all the input vectors $\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}$. In language modelling, we want to enforce constrains on the dependencies of $\\mathbf{h}_t$ to allow left-to-right or masked factorizations. A attention mask $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\{0, -\\infty \\}^{T \\times T}$ is of the same dimension as the matrix $ \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{K}^T$ and can be utilized to enforce the attention weights $\\mathbf{\\lambda}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{{\\lambda}_T}$ to be zero wherever it is necessary. The masked attention mechanism is expressed as
$$

Transformers (the decoder component) are language models can therefore be pre-train on vast amount of unlabelled text via maximum likelihood or pseudo likelihood. They allow obtaining contextualized text representations, that can be applied to a multitude of downstream tasks (question-answering, classification, ...).

Transformer-based language models consist in a single decoder component (without conditional attention). The two main alternatives for language modelling are:",1.1715879440307617,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,10.0

For instance, in the horse example, predicting the word ""fast"" will be easier to predict if some knowledge of the grammatical rules and common sense is acquired. In this example example, the model needs to learn that $\\mathbf{w}_4$ must be an adjective, and that this adjective can be attributed to a horse. Therefore, the function $f_\\theta$ must acquire a non-trivial representation of the context to make sensible token predictions$.'

Given a piece of text encoded into tokens $\\mathbf{w}_{1:T} = [\\mathbf{w_1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{w}_T]$ a *left-to-right* language model describes $\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}$ with the following factorization:

In the above figure, we represent a left-to-right language model with dependencies represented by arrows for fixed steps $t=3$ and $t=4$. Because of this choice of factorization, a language model defines a graphical model where each step $t$ depends on all the previous steps $<t$ and the conditional $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{w}_t \\mid \\mathbf{w}_{<t})$ models the dependendies between the context $\\mathbf{w}_{<t}$ and the variable $\\mathbf{w}_t$.",1.1311931610107422,notebook 5_1,19.0,"markdown:

**Bidirectional and masked language models** Autoregressive language models learn to predict a token $\\mathbf{w}_t$ given the context up to the step $t-1$. One can also use a [pseudo likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudolikelihood), where $\\mathbf{w}_t$ is not only conditioned on the preceeding tokens $\\mathbf{w}_{<t}$, but also on the next tokens $\\mathbf{w}_{>t}$. This defines a bidirectional language model, which factorizes as
$$
L_\\theta(\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}) = \\prod_{t=1}^T p_\\theta(\\mathbf{w}_t \\mid \\mathbf{w}_{-t}) \\ ,
$$
where $\\mathbf{w}_{-t}$ represent the set of tokens $\\mathbf{w}_{1:T} \\backslash \\{ \\mathbf{w}_t \\}$. We call it pseudo because this likelihood is not forming a valid distribution (because the graph formed by $\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}$ is not a directed acyclic graph (a DAG)).  Bidirectional language models such as [ELMo (""Deep contextualized word representations"", Peters et al. (2018))](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365), learn token representation contextualized on the whole context.",1.1543123722076416,notebook 5_1,13.0,"markdown:
**Beyond word2vec**  The Skip-Gram model allows us to learn meaningful word representations and arithmetic in the resulting vector space, allowing us to manipulate concepts. Ultimately, we are interested in learning representations that represent larger text fragments such as sentences, paragraphs or documents. Doing so requires combining multiple vectors, which can be done by exploiting arithmetic in the vector space or by combining word-vectors using deep neural networks, such as Transformers!

## II. Language models

We have seen how to encode text into sequences of tokens, seen how to convert tokens into vectors using a set of embeddings and experimented with a GloVe word vector space. In this section we will see how to model text at the sentence, pragraph or even document level using language models.

$$
L = - \\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf{w}_{1:T}) = - \\sum_{t=1}^T \\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf{w}_t \\mid \\mathbf{w}_{<t})
$$
Each term $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{w}_t \\mid \\mathbf{w}_{<t})$ can be evaluated using the observed variables $\\mathbf{w}_t$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{<t}$ (no sampling is required) and thus training of auto-regressive models is fast when the evaluation of $f_\\theta(\\mathbf{w}_t \\mid \\mathbf{w}_{<t})$ can be parallelized.'

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that has been succesful in modelling sequential data, e.g. language, speech, protein sequences, etc.",0.8320476412773132,notebook 5_2,1.0,"[Numpy version of the Notebook (previous version)](https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning-with-PyTorch/blob/master/5_Recurrent/OLD-5.1-Numpy-Recurrent-Neural-Networks.ipynb)'

## Representing tokens or text

In previous labs we mainly considered data $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the feature space dimension.
With time sequences our data can be represented as $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d}$, where $t$ is the sequence length. 
This emphasises sequence dependence and that the samples along the sequence are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).

With RNNs, we can model both many-to-one functions: $\\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^c$ and many-to-many functions: $\\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, c}$, where $c$ is the amount of classes/output dimensions.

There are several ways to represent sequences. With text, the challenge is how to represent a word as a feature vector in $d$ dimensions, as we are required to represent text with decimal numbers in order to apply neural networks to it.",0.8946466445922852,notebook 5_3,0.0,"markdown:
# Week 5 - Recurrent Neural Networks

In this lab, we will introduce different ways of learning from sequential data.

As a recurring example, we will train neural networks to do language modelling, i.e. predict the next token in a sentence. In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals, or videos, just to name a few.
', ""To really get a grasp of what is going on inside a recurrent neural network (RNN), we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in NumPy rather than PyTorch. We start off with a simple toy problem, build an RNN using NumPy, train and it, and see for ourselves that it really works. Once we're convinced, we proceed to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, also in NumPy. This is *not* simply to cause you frustration, but rather to provide you with a deeper understanding of the recurrence in RNNs, which will become very beneficial to you in the following weeks. Once you understand the inner workings of an RNN, we will proceed to a PyTorch implementation that you may use for the remainder of the course and in your projects."", '

A vanilla RNN suffers from [the vanishing gradients problem](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap5.html#the_vanishing_gradient_problem) which gives challenges in saving memory over longer sequences. To combat these issues the gated hidden units were created. The two most prominent gated hidden units are the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both of which have shown increased performance in saving and reusing memory in later timesteps. In this exercise, we will focus on LSTM but you would easily be able to go ahead and implement the GRU as well based on the principles that you learn here.

Below is a figure of the LSTM cell:'

In this notebook you have learned how to use embeddings, recurrent neural networks, and the LSTM cell in particular.
', ""As we have already seen, RNNs are excellent for sequential data such as language. But what do we do if we're modelling data with strong dependency in both directions? Like in many things deep learning, we can build powerful models by stacking layers on top of each other; *bi-directional* RNNs consist of two LSTM cells, one for each direction. A sequence is first fed into the forward LSTM cell and the reversed sequence is then used as input to the backward LSTM cell together with the last hidden state from the forward LSTM cell. Follow [this link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b80/89bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2.pdf) for the original paper from 1997(!)."", '
For even deeper representations, multiple layers of both uni-directional and bi-directional RNNs can be stacked ontop of each other, just like feed-forward and convolutional layers. For more information on this, check out the [LSTM PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#lstm). Next week we will also explore ways to combine RNNs with other types of layers for even more expressive function approximators.'",0.9609200954437256,notebook 5_1,23.0,"**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** A standard RNN suffers from [the vanishing gradients problem](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap5.html#the_vanishing_gradient_problem) which gives challenges in saving memory over longer sequences.

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.",1.1436522006988525,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,9.0

B303A-HOEST

Zoom (You need to sign-in with you DTU account)

We use flipped classroom teaching. During the weeks with labs, the teachers and teaching assistants will circulate between the rooms so there will be opportunity to meet all. Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.
