Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback.

More videos have been added over the years. They are all linked below. A very good alternative video resource is Hugo Larochelle’s YouTube playlist.
Week 1 - Feed-forward neural networks - do it yourself pen and paper

    During this week and the following two weeks watch video lectures: 

    Part 0 Overview
    Part 1 Deep learning
    Part 2.1 Feed-forward neural networks
    Part 2.2 Feed-forward neural networks
    Part 3 Error Backpropagation
    Part 4 Optimization

and take notes for at least 3 questions to ask. Link to lecture slides is here.

    During this week and the following two weeks read Michael Nielsen, Neural networks and deep learning http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ Chapters 1-3 (stop when reaching the section called Overfitting and regularization) and browse Chapter 4. Note that this is reading material for the first three weeks of the course. Also, in total six exercises of your own choice will be homework later in the course.
    Alternative textbooks: All topics are also covered in the deep learning book that may be read as a supplement. The book can also be bought from the DTU bookstore. You will get 10% discount with this link. Feed-forward neural networks are covered in this chapter. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to deep learning and Part II gives the necessary background on linear algebra, probability, numerical computation and machine learning. Alternative textbook 2: Chris Bishop, Pattern recognition and machine learning. If you need to up your game in mathematics, the book Mathematics for machine learning is an excellent resource and the note Mathematics for Machine Learning offers a concise and compressed collection of the mathematical concepts used in deep learning. These resources are freely available online and are very valuable sources of information.
    Install software on your laptop or go directly to Google CoLab (see above). Installation guide for laptop and cloud may be found here.
    Carry out computer exercises week 1. It is encouraged to work together with other students. Type in everything yourself. Code answers are fine not to differ much within the group and text answers should be in your own words. Note that the computer exercises may experience minor change up to 3 days before the actual session. The hand-in is the notebook with your modifications. It is only allowed to hand in .ipynb files. Each week you should only hand in one file. It is the file with EXE in its name. You hand in on peergrade.io. In order to be able to hand in on peergrade you can use this invitation link https://app.peergrade.io/join/JFFJBF or login into peergrade and use the invitation code JFFJBF. There you will receive information on handing in exercises and deadlines for activities. Some students have previously by accident signed up twice with different emails or forgotten the “student” in their DTU student mail address. If you then submit and check with different email addresses it will look as though you have not handed in.

Note that this is reading material for the first three weeks of the course. Also, in total six exercises of your own choice will be homework later in the course.
    Alternative textbooks: All topics are also covered in the deep learning book that may be read as a supplement. The book can also be bought from the DTU bookstore. You will get 10% discount with this link. Feed-forward neural networks are covered in this chapter. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to deep learning and Part II gives the necessary background on linear algebra, probability, numerical computation and machine learning. Alternative textbook 2: Chris Bishop, Pattern recognition and machine learning. If you need to up your game in mathematics, the book Mathematics for machine learning is an excellent resource and the note Mathematics for Machine Learning offers a concise and compressed collection of the mathematical concepts used in deep learning. These resources are freely available online and are very valuable sources of information.
    Install software on your laptop or go directly to Google CoLab (see above). Installation guide for laptop and cloud may be found here.
    Carry out computer exercises week 1. It is encouraged to work together with other students. Type in everything yourself. Code answers are fine not to differ much within the group and text answers should be in your own words. Note that the computer exercises may experience minor change up to 3 days before the actual session. The hand-in is the notebook with your modifications. It is only allowed to hand in .ipynb files. Each week you should only hand in one file. It is the file with EXE in its name. You hand in on peergrade.io. In order to be able to hand in on peergrade you can use this invitation link https://app.peergrade.io/join/JFFJBF or login into peergrade and use the invitation code JFFJBF. There you will receive information on handing in exercises and deadlines for activities.

In the seven project weeks we will still meet on Mondays for project work and supervision.
Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback. If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.",0.42510169744491577,CourseOutline.txt,0.0,"The purpose of this course is to give the student a detailed understanding of the deep artificial neural network models, their training, computational frameworks for deployment on fast graphical processing units, their limitations and how to formulate learning in a diverse range of settings.

We divide the day into half hour slots and your group will later be given the possibility to register for a slot. A link to sign up for the poster session will appear here in due time. So having another exam on the same day should not be a problem. We will also organise an extra exam date for those of you who cannot make it on the date. It will be group poster presentations. We will invite outside guests and we will walk around and ask questions to all groups. We will make a schedule for when the teachers visit your poster. Plan for a 2 minute presentation per group member and 1-2 minutes for questions. The remainder of the time you can either present your poster to other students and guests or go visit other posters. Remember that it is important for the overall impression that you divide the presentation and answering of the questions more or less equally between you. The poster should be in A1 format.

Week 9-13 will be only project work

In the seven project weeks we will still meet on Mondays for project work and supervision.
Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback. If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.",0.43666017055511475,CoursePlan.txt,7.0,"and take notes for at least 3 questions to ask.

We use flipped classroom teaching. During the weeks with labs, the teachers and teaching assistants will circulate between the rooms so there will be opportunity to meet all. Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.

Google CoLab

Google CoLab is a free cloud based Jupyter notebook platform with collaboration functionality. It even has GPUs and you don't need any credits, just log in with your Google account. To start, import a notebook using a github link or upload it from your pc: https://colab.research.google.com/. Setting up is quite straightforward. If you need to install libraries you can add that in a code cell with `! pip install <library name>`. You can upload some extra files (such as additional py scripts) that your jupyter notebook will use.
Other free GPU compute resources

It might be that Google CoLab will start putting restrictions if you use it too much. But there are alternatives:

Week 9-13 will be only project work

In the seven project weeks we will still meet on Mondays for project work and supervision.
Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback. If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.",0.5188772678375244,LearningObjectives.txt,0.0,"Demonstrate knowledge of machine learning terminology such as likelihood function, maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, feed-forward, convolutional and Transformer neural networks, and error back propagation.

    During this week and the following two weeks read Michael Nielsen, Neural networks and deep learning http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ Chapters 1-3 (stop when reaching the section called Overfitting and regularization) and browse Chapter 4. Note that this is reading material for the first three weeks of the course. Also, in total six exercises of your own choice will be homework later in the course.
    Alternative textbooks: All topics are also covered in the deep learning book that may be read as a supplement. The book can also be bought from the DTU bookstore. You will get 10% discount with this link. Feed-forward neural networks are covered in this chapter. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to deep learning and Part II gives the necessary background on linear algebra, probability, numerical computation and machine learning. Alternative textbook 2: Chris Bishop, Pattern recognition and machine learning. If you need to up your game in mathematics, the book Mathematics for machine learning is an excellent resource and the note Mathematics for Machine Learning offers a concise and compressed collection of the mathematical concepts used in deep learning. These resources are freely available online and are very valuable sources of information.
    Install software on your laptop or go directly to Google CoLab (see above). Installation guide for laptop and cloud may be found here.
    Carry out computer exercises week 1. It is encouraged to work together with other students. Type in everything yourself. Code answers are fine not to differ much within the group and text answers should be in your own words. Note that the computer exercises may experience minor change up to 3 days before the actual session. The hand-in is the notebook with your modifications. It is only allowed to hand in .ipynb files. Each week you should only hand in one file. It is the file with EXE in its name. You hand in on peergrade.io. In order to be able to hand in on peergrade you can use this invitation link https://app.peergrade.io/join/JFFJBF or login into peergrade and use the invitation code JFFJBF. There you will receive information on handing in exercises and deadlines for activities. Some students have previously by accident signed up twice with different emails or forgotten the “student” in their DTU student mail address. If you then submit and check with different email addresses it will look as though you have not handed in.

    Reinforcement learning - policy gradient and deep Q-learning + start of student projects. 

Week 9-13 will be only project work

In the seven project weeks we will still meet on Mondays for project work and supervision.
Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback.

More videos have been added over the years. They are all linked below. A very good alternative video resource is Hugo Larochelle’s YouTube playlist.
Week 1 - Feed-forward neural networks - do it yourself pen and paper

    During this week and the following two weeks watch video lectures: 

    Part 0 Overview
    Part 1 Deep learning
    Part 2.1 Feed-forward neural networks
    Part 2.2 Feed-forward neural networks
    Part 3 Error Backpropagation
    Part 4 Optimization

and take notes for at least 3 questions to ask. Link to lecture slides is here.

    During this week and the following two weeks read Michael Nielsen, Neural networks and deep learning http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ Chapters 1-3 (stop when reaching the section called Overfitting and regularization) and browse Chapter 4. Note that this is reading material for the first three weeks of the course. Also, in total six exercises of your own choice will be homework later in the course.
    Alternative textbooks: All topics are also covered in the deep learning book that may be read as a supplement. The book can also be bought from the DTU bookstore. You will get 10% discount with this link. Feed-forward neural networks are covered in this chapter. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to deep learning and Part II gives the necessary background on linear algebra, probability, numerical computation and machine learning. Alternative textbook 2: Chris Bishop, Pattern recognition and machine learning. If you need to up your game in mathematics, the book Mathematics for machine learning is an excellent resource and the note Mathematics for Machine Learning offers a concise and compressed collection of the mathematical concepts used in deep learning. These resources are freely available online and are very valuable sources of information.
    Install software on your laptop or go directly to Google CoLab (see above). Installation guide for laptop and cloud may be found here.
    Carry out computer exercises week 1. It is encouraged to work together with other students. Type in everything yourself. Code answers are fine not to differ much within the group and text answers should be in your own words. Note that the computer exercises may experience minor change up to 3 days before the actual session. The hand-in is the notebook with your modifications. It is only allowed to hand in .ipynb files. Each week you should only hand in one file. It is the file with EXE in its name. You hand in on peergrade.io. In order to be able to hand in on peergrade you can use this invitation link https://app.peergrade.io/join/JFFJBF or login into peergrade and use the invitation code JFFJBF. There you will receive information on handing in exercises and deadlines for activities. Some students have previously by accident signed up twice with different emails or forgotten the “student” in their DTU student mail address. If you then submit and check with different email addresses it will look as though you have not handed in.

We use flipped classroom teaching. During the weeks with labs, the teachers and teaching assistants will circulate between the rooms so there will be opportunity to meet all. Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.

Google CoLab is a free cloud based Jupyter notebook platform with collaboration functionality. It even has GPUs and you don't need any credits, just log in with your Google account. To start, import a notebook using a github link or upload it from your pc: https://colab.research.google.com/. Setting up is quite straightforward. If you need to install libraries you can add that in a code cell with `! pip install <library name>`. You can upload some extra files (such as additional py scripts) that your jupyter notebook will use.

Week 9-13 will be only project work

In the seven project weeks we will still meet on Mondays for project work and supervision.
Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback. If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.",0.4045374393463135,CourseOutline.txt,0.0,"The purpose of this course is to give the student a detailed understanding of the deep artificial neural network models, their training, computational frameworks for deployment on fast graphical processing units, their limitations and how to formulate learning in a diverse range of settings. These settings include classification, regression, sequences and other types of structured input and outputs and for reasoning in complex environments.

The course outline is:
1. Introduction to statistical machine learning, feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and error back-propagation. Part I do it yourself on pen and paper.
2. Introduction to statistical machine learning, feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and error back-propagation. Part II do it yourself in NumPy.

Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.

Google CoLab is a free cloud based Jupyter notebook platform with collaboration functionality. It even has GPUs and you don't need any credits, just log in with your Google account. To start, import a notebook using a github link or upload it from your pc: https://colab.research.google.com/. Setting up is quite straightforward. If you need to install libraries you can add that in a code cell with `! pip install <library name>`. You can upload some extra files (such as additional py scripts) that your jupyter notebook will use.

Week 9-13 will be only project work

In the seven project weeks we will still meet on Mondays for project work and supervision.
Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback. If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.",0.4079377055168152,CourseOutline.txt,0.0,"The purpose of this course is to give the student a detailed understanding of the deep artificial neural network models, their training, computational frameworks for deployment on fast graphical processing units, their limitations and how to formulate learning in a diverse range of settings.

We use flipped classroom teaching. During the weeks with labs, the teachers and teaching assistants will circulate between the rooms so there will be opportunity to meet all. Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.

Google CoLab is a free cloud based Jupyter notebook platform with collaboration functionality. It even has GPUs and you don't need any credits, just log in with your Google account. To start, import a notebook using a github link or upload it from your pc: https://colab.research.google.com/. Setting up is quite straightforward. If you need to install libraries you can add that in a code cell with `! pip install <library name>`. You can upload some extra files (such as additional py scripts) that your jupyter notebook will use.

We divide the day into half hour slots and your group will later be given the possibility to register for a slot. A link to sign up for the poster session will appear here in due time. So having another exam on the same day should not be a problem. We will also organise an extra exam date for those of you who cannot make it on the date. It will be group poster presentations. We will invite outside guests and we will walk around and ask questions to all groups. We will make a schedule for when the teachers visit your poster. Plan for a 2 minute presentation per group member and 1-2 minutes for questions. The remainder of the time you can either present your poster to other students and guests or go visit other posters. Remember that it is important for the overall impression that you divide the presentation and answering of the questions more or less equally between you. The poster should be in A1 format. Remember to put both your names and student numbers under title. Here and here are links to examples using the latex template and here is one in powerpoint. You do not have to use that.

    Reinforcement learning - policy gradient and deep Q-learning + start of student projects. 

Week 9-13 will be only project work

In the seven project weeks we will still meet on Mondays for project work and supervision.
Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback. If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.",0.4467117488384247,CourseOutline.txt,0.0,"The purpose of this course is to give the student a detailed understanding of the deep artificial neural network models, their training, computational frameworks for deployment on fast graphical processing units, their limitations and how to formulate learning in a diverse range of settings. These settings include classification, regression, sequences and other types of structured input and outputs and for reasoning in complex environments.

The course outline is:
1. Introduction to statistical machine learning, feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and error back-propagation. Part I do it yourself on pen and paper.
2. Introduction to statistical machine learning, feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and error back-propagation. Part II do it yourself in NumPy.

Google CoLab

Google CoLab is a free cloud based Jupyter notebook platform with collaboration functionality. It even has GPUs and you don't need any credits, just log in with your Google account. To start, import a notebook using a github link or upload it from your pc: https://colab.research.google.com/. Setting up is quite straightforward. If you need to install libraries you can add that in a code cell with `! pip install <library name>`. You can upload some extra files (such as additional py scripts) that your jupyter notebook will use.
Other free GPU compute resources

It might be that Google CoLab will start putting restrictions if you use it too much. But there are alternatives:

In the seven project weeks we will still meet on Mondays for project work and supervision.
Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback. If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.",0.3171417713165283,CourseOutline.txt,0.0,"The purpose of this course is to give the student a detailed understanding of the deep artificial neural network models, their training, computational frameworks for deployment on fast graphical processing units, their limitations and how to formulate learning in a diverse range of settings. These settings include classification, regression, sequences and other types of structured input and outputs and for reasoning in complex environments.

The course outline is:
1. Introduction to statistical machine learning, feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and error back-propagation. Part I do it yourself on pen and paper.
2. Introduction to statistical machine learning, feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) and error back-propagation. Part II do it yourself in NumPy.
