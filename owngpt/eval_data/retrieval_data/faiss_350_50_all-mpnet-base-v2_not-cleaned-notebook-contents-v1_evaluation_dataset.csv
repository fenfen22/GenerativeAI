    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

We use flipped classroom teaching. During the weeks with labs, the teachers and teaching assistants will circulate between the rooms so there will be opportunity to meet all. Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.
    A lab session is passed by:

    grading the reports from lab sessions of 3 other students on Peergrade and
    passing the lab as judged by the teacher. More details given below.",0.9188689589500427,CoursePlan.txt,16.0,"and take notes for at least 3 questions to ask. Link to lecture slides 2016 lecture slides, 2017 blog post and 2020 lecture slides.

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.

    The student gains access to the final project by passing 6 out of 8 lab sessions that precede it.

More details on peer grading: The 8 lab sessions are evaluated using peer grading. We use peer grading to ensure more accurate evaluation and better feedback. Graders get 3 reports at each deadline and have one week to carry out the feedback. If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.  

Handing in and peer grading six of the eight labs reports is required for being able to execute the project and eventually pass the course.

You can also contact the teacher directly on Slack if something went wrong with the submission of the lab. Peergrade deadlines are strict so no need to write about getting an extension.

Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.

Time: Mondays at 13:00-17:00 (first session is August 28th, 2023)

Locations: We will use the following rooms - building/room - (Campus map):

B303A-A042

B303A-046

B303A-047

B303A-048

B303A-HOEST

Zoom (You need to sign-in with you DTU account)

We use flipped classroom teaching. During the weeks with labs, the teachers and teaching assistants will circulate between the rooms so there will be opportunity to meet all. Any short lectures/instructions will be repeated in all rooms. You are free to choose whatever room you prefer of course respecting the limits on room capacity. During the weeks with project work each room will cover specific topics.

If you are not able to be on campus or prefer to work remotely you will be able to participate through Zoom. One teaching assistant will be dedicated to the Zoom channel: Zoom.

We also use Slack for communication: We will make dedicated channels for labs and projects. Here is a Slack invite link. (In Slack you can add channels from the list of channels by clicking the “+” next to Channels in the left panel and click “Browse channels” to choose.)

Bring a laptop.

The first eight weeks of the course will be dedicated to lab work. There will be a brief introduction to the course at the first session and a number of dedicated meetings online or in person with project supervisors.

Evaluation and peer grading during the course

​​Evaluation:

    The course is graded using the 7-step scale.
    The final grade is based solely on the evaluation of the final project, which starts in the 7th week of the course. The project group should consist of 3-4 students. In special circumstances we can also accept groups of 1 or 2 students. (In the course catalogue it says 1-3 students. We will correct that for next year but cannot change it now.)
    The evaluation of the final project is based on two parts, both of which are done in groups but evaluated individually:

    a poster exam presentation, where the project groups document the results of their project in a poster and present to two or more teachers acting as examiners and
    a report in which the project groups document their solution. The report should be a maximum of 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format.

More details are given below.
